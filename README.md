# Mars Rover Team (MRT) Assignments - IIT Bombay

Welcome to the Mars Rover Team (MRT) assignment repository. This repository contains all my assignments for the MRT trainee program. Each assignment is organized into its respective numbered folder.

## Repository Structure

This repository is structured with folders numbered sequentially, where each folder corresponds to an assignment:

```
.
├── 1/
│   ├── main.cpp
│   ├── report.pdf
├── 2/
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── data/
├── 3/
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

### Folders:
- Each folder (e.g., `1/`, `2/`, `3/`) corresponds to an assignment.
- Inside each folder, you will find:
  - `main.*`: The main code for the assignment.
  - `report.pdf`: A report or documentation associated with the assignment.
  - Any other necessary files (e.g., `data/` folders, supplementary scripts).

## How to Navigate

- To view the code and reports for each assignment, navigate to the respective folder:
  ```bash
  cd <assignment-folder-number>
  ```
  For example, to access assignment 1:
  ```bash

- Each folder contains its own `README.md` explaining the details of that specific assignment.
